                        <p>How you decide which software, tool or service you use depends on your aggregator, lifestyle goals and the mental framework you are operating within.</p>

                        <p>So how do you choose what software, service or process works best for your business model?</p>

                            <p>We are not owned by an aggregator, software company or service provider.</p>
                            <p>We assess software and services based on value, features, performance and broker feedback - not on who pays us.</p>
                            <p>Our listings, write-ups and comparison criteria are built to help brokers make informed decisions, not to favour any provider.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, we do "default" and often recommend one software over another because time-over-time they have proven themselves to be the best option.</p>

                            <p>Broker Tools is run by people who have:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                                <li>Designed CRM systems</li>
                                <li>Implemented automations</li>
                                <li>Worked with brokers and finance teams daily</li>
                                <li>Tested dozens of industry platforms</li>
                                <li>Delivered integrations, workflows and optimisation projects</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We know how brokers actually work - what tools they need, where bottlenecks happen, and which platforms make a real difference to their productivity.</p>

                            <p>Broker Tools is free for users.</p>
                            <p>We may earn revenue in a few ways - but we are always open about it:</p>
                            <div className="space-y-2">
                                <p className="font-semibold">Referral Partnerships</p>
                                <p>If you choose to sign up for certain software or services through our links, we may earn a commission.</p>
                                <p>This never affects what we recommend, how we rank providers, or what we write.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div className="space-y-2">
                                <p className="font-semibold">Featured Listings</p>
                                <p>Some vendors may pay for premium placement or additional visibility.</p>
                                <p>These are clearly labelled and still must meet our quality criteria.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p className="font-semibold">Sponsored Content</p>
                                <p>Occasionally, a provider may sponsor an article or guide.</p>
                                <p>These are always marked as "Sponsored" and kept separate from editorial reviews.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Our goal is simple: be as transparent as possible while keeping Broker Tools free to use.</p>

                            <p>We collect information directly from:</p>

                                <li>Vendor websites and documentation</li>

                                <li>Industry updates, pricing changes and feature releases</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Every listing is structured around what brokers care about most:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                                <li>Features that actually matter</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>And we review and update our data regularly so you are never relying on out-of-date information.</p>

                            <p>We break software and services into criteria that brokers understand, including:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                                <li>CRM strength</li>

                                <li>Ideal broker type (solo, small team, commercial, asset, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Our goal: no jargon, no fluff - just clarity.</p>

                            <p>A broker's tech stack works as an ecosystem.</p>
                            <p>So Broker Tools compares not just products, but how they connect:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                                <li>Which tools integrate cleanly</li>
                                <li>What "works with" what</li>
                                <li>Where gaps and overlaps exist</li>
                                <li>Which combinations deliver the best client workflows</li>
                                <li>Smart recommendations based on your broker type</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This makes Broker Tools more than a directory - it is a systems-level comparison engine.</p>

                            <p>We never sell personal information, and any analytics we use help us improve the platform - not track individuals.</p>
