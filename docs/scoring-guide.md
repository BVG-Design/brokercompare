# Scoring Guide

Broker Compare rubric scores summarize how well each product performs across core evaluation categories.

## How rubric scores are calculated

- **Category scores** average the 0–10 scores for individual features within the same rubric category.
- **Overall rubric score** is the average of all category scores for that product.
- If a category has no scored features yet, it is marked as **Not scored**.

## How to interpret the scores

- **9–10:** Best-in-class capability and coverage for the category.
- **7–8.9:** Strong capabilities with minor gaps or limitations.
- **5–6.9:** Solid foundation but noticeable trade-offs.
- **Below 5:** Emerging or limited support.

These scores are meant to complement reviews and pricing—use the rubric breakdown to identify strengths that matter most to your workflow.
